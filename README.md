Behavioural/Hiring Manager round( 1 day before interview)
The behavioral round is often taken by the hiring manager. They may or may not deep dive into your technical skills. It's good to prepare answers related to the skills and projects mentioned on your resume. Prepare at least one project that you are confident about. The answers in this round are expected to be in STAR format.
Tips

1. Give mock interviews under STAR format and prepare answers for the top competency-based asked.
2. If you are aiming for a senior role/lead mention your team handling skills.
3. Read about the company values and frame your answers based on the values for example Amazon has its own leadership principles that you can talk about while answering the questions.
4. Keep your answers precise with keywords.
5. Try to keep it technical and don't make false narratives.
6. Don't answer any questions in a negative tone.
7. Prepare a list of questions that you can ask the hiring manager.
